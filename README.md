# Assessing Water Stress, International Migration, and Development Nexus using Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Interpretable Machine Learning
The main objectives of this project are
1. To identify the important interactions between water stress, development status, population density, GDP per capita, national rainfall index, and total population with access to safe drinking water in migrant origin and destination countries and how these interactions influence international out-migration and in-migration.
2. To explore the similarities and differences between the different machine learning models and how these machine learning models can be made more interpretable to understand the complex interactions of the response variables.
